ML_Assignment
=============

In this prediction exercise, we used the dataset collected using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand and Fitbit to predict the manner in which the subjects did the weight lifting exercise. In order to build the model, we first needed to understand the data and conduct exploratory data analysis, which led us to preprocess the data into a more tidy data frame.

You can find the Rmd and compiled HTML file in this github repo.
